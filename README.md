Rockbuster Data Analytics Project
Introduction
Welcome to the Rockbuster Data Analytics Project! This project showcases my work as a data analyst, where I analyzed data for Rockbuster, a company aiming to enter the online rental market, similar to Netflix and Amazon. I utilized SQL to extract insights about their sales, revenue, customer locations, popular genres, rental durations, rental rates, and replacement costs. This README document provides an overview of the project and can serve as a demonstration of my skills for potential job opportunities.

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to utilize data analytics techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of Rockbuster's operations and offer valuable insights. Through SQL analysis of their sales database, I extracted meaningful information and presented it in a clear and concise manner. The insights gained from this analysis can assist Rockbuster in making informed decisions and formulating effective strategies to succeed in the online rental market.

Key Findings
During the analysis, the following key findings were uncovered:

Sales and Revenue: I analyzed the sales data to determine the total revenue generated by Rockbuster. This information provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance, facilitating an assessment of its market presence.

Customer Locations: By examining customer data, I identified the geographical distribution of Rockbuster's customer base. This insight is invaluable for targeted marketing efforts and identifying potential areas for expansion.

Popular Genres: Through the analysis of movie genres preferred by Rockbuster's customers, I identified the most popular genres. This information can aid in curating a diverse and engaging movie catalog, enhancing customer satisfaction and engagement.

Rental Durations: By exploring rental duration data, I determined both the minimum and maximum durations for movie rentals. This insight can guide Rockbuster in setting optimal rental periods and pricing plans to maximize customer satisfaction and profitability.

Rental Rates: I investigated the rental rates for various movies and identified the minimum and maximum rates. This knowledge can assist Rockbuster in determining competitive pricing strategies to attract customers while maintaining profitability.

Replacement Costs: By examining replacement cost data, I assessed the financial impact of movie replacements due to loss or damage. This insight enables effective inventory management and budget planning for Rockbuster.

Project Files
SQL Scripts: The project includes SQL scripts used to extract, transform, and analyze the data. These scripts are organized into logical sections to ensure readability and reproducibility.

PowerPoint Presentation: I created a PowerPoint presentation to present the key findings and insights derived from the analysis. The presentation is designed to be easily understood by non-technical stakeholders and can be used for presentations and discussions.

README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the methodology used. It serves as a guide to understand the project's structure and offers an overview of the key findings.
